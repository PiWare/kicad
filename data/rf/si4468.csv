Part,Si4468,,
Package,QFN20,,
Number,Pin,Type,
1,SDN,I,"Shutdown Input Pin. 0–VDD V digital input. SDN should be = 0 in all modes except Shutdown mode. When SDN = 1, the chip will be completely shut down, and the contents of the registers will be lost."
2,RXp,I,Differential RF Input Pins of the LNA. See application schematic for example matching network.
3,RXn,I,
4,TX,O,"Transmit Output Pin. The PA output is an open-drain connection, so the L-C match must supply VDD (+3.3 VDC nominal) to this pin."
5,NC,N,It is recommended to connect to GND per the reference design schematic. Not connected internally to any circuitry.
6,VDD,VDD,+1.8 to +3.8 V Supply Voltage Input to Internal Regulators. The recommended VDD supply voltage is +3.3 V.
7,TXRAMP,O,"Programmable Bias Output with Ramp Capability for External FET PA. See ""5.4. Transmitter (TX)"" on page 33."
8,VDD,VDD,+1.8 to +3.8 V Supply Voltage Input to Internal Regulators. The recommended VDD supply voltage is +3.3 V.
9,GPIO0,I/O,"General Purpose Digital I/O. May be configured through the registers to perform various functions including: Microcontroller Clock Output, FIFO status, POR, Wake-Up timer, Low Battery Detect, TRSW, AntDiversity control, etc."
10,GPIO1,I/O,
11,nIRQ,O,"General Microcontroller Interrupt Status Output. When the Si446X exhibits any one of the interrupt events, the nIRQ pin will be set low = 0. The Microcontroller can then determine the state of the interrupt by reading the interrupt status. No external resistor pull-up is required, but it may be desirable if multiple interrupt lines are connected."
12,SCLK,I,Serial Clock Input. 0–VDD V digital input. This pin provides the serial data clock function for the 4-line serial data bus. Data is clocked into the Si446x on positive edge transi- tions.
13,SDO,O,0–VDD V Digital Output. Provides a serial readback function of the internal control registers.
14,SDI,I,Serial Data Input. 0–VDD V digital input. This pin provides the serial data stream for the 4-line serial data bus.
15,nSEL,I,Serial Interface Select Input. 0–VDD V digital input. This pin provides the Select/Enable function for the 4-line serial data bus.
16,XOUT,O,"Crystal Oscillator Output. Connect to an external 25 to 32 MHz crystal, or leave floating when driving with an external source on XIN."
17,XIN,I,"Crystal Oscillator Input. Connect to an external 25 to 32 MHz crystal, or connect to an external source."
18,GND,GND,"When using an XTAL, leave floating per the reference design schematic. When using a TCXO, connect to TCXO GND, which should be separate from the board’s reference ground plane."
19,GPIO2,I/O,"General Purpose Digital I/O. May be configured through the registers to perform various functions, including Microcontroller Clock Output, FIFO status, POR, Wake-Up timer, Low Battery Detect, TRSW, AntDiversity control, etc."
20,GPIO3,I/O,
21,PADDLE_GND,GND,The exposed metal paddle on the bottom of the Si446x supplies the RF and cir- cuit ground(s) for the entire chip. It is very important that a good solder connec- tion is made between this exposed metal paddle and the ground plane of the PCB underlying the Si446x.
