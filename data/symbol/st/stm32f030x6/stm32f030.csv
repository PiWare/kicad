"1. PC13, PC14 and PC15 are supplied through the power switch. Since the switch only sinks a limited amount of current (3 mA), the use of GPIOs PC13 to PC15 in output mode is limited: - The speed should not exceed 2 MHz with a maximum load of 30 pF. - These GPIOs must not be used as current sources (e.g. to drive an LED). 2. This feature is available on STM32F030x6 and STM32F030x4 devices only. 3. This feature is available on STM32F030x8 devices only. 4. For STM32F030x4/6/8 devices only. 5. For STM32F030xC devices only. 6. On LQFP32 package, PB2 and PB8 should be treated as unconnected pins (even when they are not available on the package, they are not forced to a defined level by hardware). 7. After reset, these pins are configured as SWDIO and SWCLK alternate functions, and the internal pull-up on SWDIO pin and internal pull-down on SWCLK pin are activated. 33/96 DocID024849 Rev 2",,,,,,,,,
